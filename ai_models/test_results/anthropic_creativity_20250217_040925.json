  "response": "\"The Last Drop\"\n\nThe coffee cup sat innocently on Maria's desk, its white ceramic surface stained with the rings of a thousand morning brews. She'd found it at a thrift store, attracted by its peculiar geometric patterns that seemed to shift when you weren't looking directly at them.\n\nThis morning, as she poured her usual dark roast, something strange happened. The coffee didn't settle at the bottom of the cup \u2013 instead, it began to swirl counterclockwise, faster and faster. Before Maria could drop the cup in surprise, the world around her blurred.\n\nWhen everything came back into focus, she was still holding the cup, but her office had vanished. She stood in what appeared to be an ancient Mayan temple, where robed figures were conducting a ceremony with a similar-looking vessel, filled with a dark liquid that definitely wasn't coffee.\n\nA priest looked up, unsurprised by her presence. \"Ah, the Cup of Chronos returns again,\" he said in perfect English. \"We've been expecting you. Would you care for some chocolate?\"\n\nMaria looked down at her cup, noticing for the first time that the geometric patterns were actually tiny calendars, each marking a different era in human history. She realized her morning coffee routine had just become considerably more interesting.\n\nJust then, the liquid began to swirl again. Maria caught a glimpse of what looked like Victorian London through the steam before everything blurred once more. She made a mental note to start bringing sugar packets with her \u2013 one never knew when or where the next coffee break might be.",
