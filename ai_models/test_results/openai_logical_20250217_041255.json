Take the chicken across the river and leave it on the other side.\n2. Go back and take the fox across the river.\n3. Leave the fox on the other side and take the chicken back with him.\n4. Leave the chicken on the original side and take the bag of corn across the river.\n5. Finally, go back and get the chicken to bring it to the other side.\n\nThis way, the farmer successfully crosses the river with all items intact.",
