  "prompt": "Solve this logic puzzle: A farmer needs to cross a river with a fox, a chicken, and a bag of corn...",
  "response": " (you know the one). The farmer has a small boat that can only hold himself and one of the three items. How does he get everything across the river safely?\nThe farmer takes the chicken across the river first and leaves it on the other side. Then, he goes back to the original side and picks up the bag of corn. He takes the bag of corn across the river and leaves it on the other side with the chicken. However, he takes the chicken back to the original side. Next, he picks up the fox and takes it across the river, leaving it on the other side with the bag of corn. Finally, he goes back to the original side and picks up the chicken, taking it across the river to join the fox and the bag of corn.\nThe key to this puzzle is to make sure the fox and the chicken are never left together, and the chicken and the bag of corn are never left together. By following this sequence, the farmer is able to get everything across the river safely.\nNow, let's try a more complex puzzle:\nThere are three switches, but they are not labelled. Each switch corresponds to one of three light bulbs in a room. Each light bulb is either on or off. You can turn the switches on and off",
