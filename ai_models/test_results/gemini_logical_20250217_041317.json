  "response": "The differences between consecutive terms are:\n\n* 6 - 2 = 4\n* 12 - 6 = 6\n* 20 - 12 = 8\n\nThe differences are increasing by 2 each time. This suggests a quadratic pattern.  The next difference should be 8 + 2 = 10.\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence is 20 + 10 = $\\boxed{30}$.\n",
