But I see what you mean about your sense of humor being dry. I think that might be worse than mine being dirty.\u201d\n\n\u201cMine is dry with a dash of sarcasm,\u201d I said as we walked into the building where our office was located. \u201cSo if your humor can be considered blue, then mine can be considered gray.\u201d\n\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d Alex murmured as we stepped into the elevator.\n\nWe were quiet for the ride up to the floor where our office was located. Alex held my hand, but neither one of us spoke until the elevator doors opened with a soft ding.\n\n\u201cAlex?\u201d I asked softly as he led me out onto the floor. \u201cCan we go back down? This floor gives me the creeps. It always has, even before all this shit happened with my dad. And after\u2026\u201d\n\nMy voice trailed off, but Alex knew exactly what I meant. After my dad had been arrested, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to walk down the hallways without feeling like everyone was watching me with judgmental eyes. It didn\u2019t matter if they were or not\u2014the feeling persisted anyway. The fact that I hadn\u2019t set foot on this floor since it all went down only added to the feeling that something bad was going to happen to me here.\n\nAlex nodded, understanding written all over his face. He pulled me in close to him and wrapped his arm around my shoulders. I let my head fall against his chest, listening to the steady thump of his heartbeat beneath his shirt. His smell enveloped me, and for a moment, I felt safe and protected from the outside world.\n\nBut the feeling quickly dissipated when the elevator dinged again, announcing its arrival on the ground floor. I shivered involuntarily as Alex led me out onto the busy street outside our building.\n\nThe sounds of traffic washed over me, and I closed my eyes briefly, letting it drown out my thoughts for just a few seconds.\n\nWhen I opened them again, I found Alex staring at me with a soft smile on his face. \u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\nI shrugged. \u201c",
