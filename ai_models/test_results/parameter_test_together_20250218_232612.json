All my internal organs followed suit. It felt like someone picked me up at my armpits and started shaking the shit out of me. \u201cWhat happened!? What the fuck is going on!?\u201d My brain did not process what was happening. My body was violated by my own consciousness. I fell off the picnic table and hit my head but didn\u2019t knock myself out completely. I remember saying something like: \u201cI think\u2013I think I\u2019m gonna dieeee . . . AHHH!!!\u201d Somebody called 911 but we couldn\u2019t wait so I was loaded into somebody\u2019s car to be taken to the hospital. I think two or three days passed but it could have just as easily been two months. I was on morphine when the guy who called 911 told me: \u201cDude, when I found you during your seizure, your fucking eyes rolled all the way the back!\u201d While this information helped clear everything up right away, being high off morphine made everything pretty clear anyway.\n\nWhen they finally let me go I stayed over at my friend Michael\u2019s place which was convenient since he only lived about 5 minutes from the beach. His parents made everything convenient because their insurance covered every little pill/shot to make sure I would get better. When I eventually came back to school after missing five weeks\u2013Michael brought me on a tour of where all my classes were located and where all my textbooks would be handed in. It took me five months to not need more than two crutches instead of four to walk around. The entire following year all this stuff gave me really bad anxiety since all this shit really fucked with my confidence; any time before then was usually spent sleeping or talking to people who actually gave a fuck. There weren\u2019t any real issues. If I looked down to tie my shoelaces when walking then there was no problem; I could pull off tripping over invisible objects without anybody noticing, although most people told me afterwards that they thought something wasn\u2019t normal: that my ankles twitched or something similar before each seizure. That was why Michael called 911 within a minute instead of waiting till I stopped breathing (which might not happen).\n\nIt took another five years to get rid of the anxiety. Anxiety is a funny thing though because as soon as you see how funny it is you stop being afraid of getting your ass kicked by whatever situation causes anxiety\u2013or whomever initiates such activity while using a different organ than the ass-kicked ones (as long as you can avoid said organ). But sometimes it still fucks with my confidence, making me want to take some sort of drug. Which is what probably caused the entire ordeal in the first place: the consumption of magic mushrooms. Some sources claim that such drugs can cause seizures if abused, but even taking them once is technically abusing the substance. I will try to find more info on this topic. You should consider looking into it yourself.",

      "response": "?\u201d\n\nBob stood up and did his best to make light of things. \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between...\u201d He couldn\u2019t remember any riddles, so he just shrugged. \u201cOh well.\u201d He smiled at her again, took the book from her hand gently. \u201cI told you I wasn\u2019t going to play that game.\u201d Bob shook his head and walked over to where the pile of clothes was located in the hospital room.\n\n\u201cThen give me something for my pain,\u201d she protested. Tears were starting to well up in her eyes as she spoke with a voice that was broken. \u201cEverything hurts so bad!\u201d She reached down towards her knees.\n\nBob sat down next to her and tried to remember what they taught about pain relief. \u201cI have these pills here for your pain,\u201d he began and reached into his lab coat pocket, pulling out a few extra hydrocodone tablets he grabbed on the way into the room. The doctor had asked Bob to come talk with the patient so he had picked up some extras off the top of one of the medicine carts near the patient rooms. He had no intention of actually prescribing these to her but figured it wouldn\u2019t hurt if the patient took a few when she got discharged by another physician later. Bob put the hydrocodones on the bedside tray next to the orange juice. It was the same orange juice cup used with nearly every pediatric patient because it had a twistable top, perfect so kids could open it themselves. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you drink this now while you take these pills? You won\u2019t feel them going down your throat as much. Then when they hit your stomach, they will start working quickly on the pain.\u201d\n\nThe little girl stopped crying long enough to grab the cup with one hand and fumbled around for the twisting lid piece with the other one. She turned it, causing one of pill to spill onto her sheets while the rest made their way into an open mouth. After swallowing several times without any liquid, she took a sip from the cup then set it back down again before reaching back for another pill in Bob\u2019s hand. She ate them gratefully and drank more orange juice as she started laughing again, albeit with very little force behind each sound. Her body still trembled though.\n\nBob noticed her shirt slipping over one shoulder due to her odd posture and repositioned it so her arm would be covered. As he did, he noticed two large bruises on it. More bruisese on her abdomen led him to think there was domestic violence. For an eight year old in our society, no bruise is normal. So many people will deny and justify physical punishment towards their kids, stating how well behaved they are or saying we need more discipline in society. But there is no reason good enough to ever bruise a child.\n\nBob wanted to say something to help but knew he would be treading deep waters if he entered into that subject area. Domestic violence is such a difficult problem for society at large and hospitals as well. In fact, many of the physicians Bob worked with avoided patients with potential signs of domestic violence because it seemed too much like trying to solve the nation's gun control issue during a single hospital shift. Sometimes all health professionals can do is refer the victim to law enforcement officers who may or may not go after the predator responsible for harming somebody under the age of majority. That alone causes significant distress within the hospital community, since nearly everybody has seen cases go to court only to end with the defendant getting away unscathed yet again. And why isn\u2019t it a surprise, given how powerful that same group can be in Congress and elsewhere around the country.\n\nThe worst thing was how little Bob knew of his own colleague\u2019s personal lives. When he saw bruises on adult body parts during routine health screening appointments for patients over eighteen years old, he might make referrals depending on the severity of said markings. A lot of hospitals today have staff members who function as hospital advocates for victims of domestic abuse. They go through certain training courses beforehand, sometimes required by state statutes, then act more like mediators than anything else between law enforcement agencies and hospital services. Of course those same advocates might do some counseling behind the scenes with some patients but usually avoid telling family members about these sessions altogether. All these precuations seemed necessary considering many women (or men) don\u2019t want to bring others into their home for fear of further retribution.\n\nStill, nobody knows what happens once a patient leaves the hospital building. Many survivors will hide the bruises for fear of being ostracized by friends or family members after word gets around;",
