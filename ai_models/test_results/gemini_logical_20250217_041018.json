  "response": "The differences between consecutive terms are 4, 6, 8.  This suggests the differences are increasing linearly, which indicates a quadratic pattern.\n\nThe differences between these differences (second differences) are constant at 2. This confirms a quadratic pattern.  The next difference should be 8 + 2 = 10.\n\nTherefore, the next term in the sequence is 20 + 10 = $\\boxed{30}$.\n",
